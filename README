bib-publication-list to automatically generate an interactive HTML publication list from a BibTeX file

Getting Started
===============
First, load the required JavaScript files:

<script src="protovis-r3.1.js"></script> <!-- if you want the visualization -->
<script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="bib-list-min.js"></script>

All you need to do is to include the BibTeX into an HTML page and tell the script to turn it 
into a sortable and searchable table. For example:

<table id="pubTable" class="display"></table>
<pre id="bibtex">@article{Karavirta:JVLCTaxonomy,
title = {A comprehensive taxonomy of algorithm animation languages},
journal = {Journal of Visual Languages \& Computing},
volume = {20},
number = {1},
pages = {1--22},
year = {2010},
issn = {1045-926X},
doi = {DOI: 10.1016/j.jvlc.2009.09.001},
author = {Ville Karavirta and Ari Korhonen and Lauri Malmi and Thomas Naps}
}
</pre>

Finally, the bib-publication-list needs to know the input data element and the output table. So, one 
line of JavaScript:

bibtexify("#bibtex", "pubTable");

Alternatively, the bibtex can be loaded from a file. Personally I prefer including it in the HTML, 
though. This way, browsers without JavaScript enabled get at least to see the bibtex instead of a blank page.
This causes an ugly-looking flash of unstyled content, though.

bibtexify("example-biblist.bib", "pubTable");

The result looks like my publication list at: http://villekaravirta.com/publications/.


Configuration Options
=====================
The bibtexify function accepts an optional third parameter for configuration options. These options include:

protovis     A boolean to control addition of the visualization. Defaults to true.
             If set to false, protovis JavaScript file is not needed.
tweet        Twitter username to add Tweet links to bib items with a url field.
sorting      Control the default sorting of the list. Defaults to [[0, "desc"], [1, "desc"]].
             See http://datatables.net/api fnSort for details on formatting.


Building from source
====================
There is a Jakefile for building the combined and minified versions with Jake (https://github.com/mde/jake)
and a Makefile for building with make.
